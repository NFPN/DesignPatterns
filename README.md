# Design Patterns Learning Samples


This is a personal design patterns in .Net C# learning samples,
In order to understand their basic setup.

Also I added my own changes and intellisense suggestions to simplify.

The patterns learned so far are:

 - [Command Pattern](https://github.com/NFPN/DesignPatterns/tree/main/DesignPatterns/Patterns/CommandPattern) (Food ordering system)
 - [Mediator Pattern](https://github.com/NFPN/DesignPatterns/tree/main/DesignPatterns/Patterns/MediatorPattern) (Snack shop communication system)
 - [Composite Pattern](https://github.com/NFPN/DesignPatterns/tree/main/DesignPatterns/Patterns/CompositePattern) (Drink machine)
